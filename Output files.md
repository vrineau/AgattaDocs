# Output files

This page lists all the output files of Agatta according to the command and optional flag to generate them.

The name of an output file is `prefix.extension`. The extension depends on the command (see table below) and reflects the content of the file. The prefix is by default `agatta_out` but can be changed by setting the `prefix=filename` flag.
